# nnUNetv2 Performance Improvement Strategy (after baseline)

## **Architecture Modifications**

### **Multi-task Learning Architecture**
- [ ] **Add a classification head** to your nnUNetv2 model with a shared encoder. The project specifies you need separate decoder heads for segmentation and classification
- [ ] **Implement proper feature fusion** between segmentation and classification tasks - shared features can help both tasks
- [ ] **Consider attention mechanisms** in the classification head to focus on relevant regions

### **Network Architecture Variants**
- [ ] Try different nnUNetv2 trainer variants like `nnUNetTrainerDA5` which includes enhanced data augmentation
- [ ] Experiment with different backbone configurations (2D, 3D_fullres, 3D_lowres, 3D_cascade_fullres)
- [ ] Consider ensemble methods combining multiple configurations

## **Training Strategy Improvements**

### **Advanced Data Augmentation**
Based on the code, you can leverage enhanced augmentation strategies:
- [ ] **Spatial transforms**: rotation, scaling, elastic deformation
- [ ] **Intensity transforms**: brightness, contrast, gamma correction, Gaussian noise
- [ ] **Domain-specific augmentation**: simulate low resolution, Gaussian blur, median filtering
- [ ] **Advanced augmentation variants**: Try `nnUNetTrainerDA5` which includes more sophisticated augmentation pipelines

### **Loss Function Optimization**
- [ ] **Multi-task loss weighting**: Balance segmentation (Dice + Cross-entropy) and classification losses
- [ ] **Focal loss** for addressing class imbalance in pancreas lesion segmentation
- [ ] **Deep supervision** with multiple loss scales
- [ ] **Class-weighted losses** given the challenge of small lesion detection

### **Training Configuration**
- [ ] **Extended training epochs**: The default 1000 epochs can be reduced for computational efficiency, but ensure convergence
- [ ] **Learning rate scheduling**: Use PolyLR scheduler with proper warm-up
- [ ] **Cross-validation strategy**: Ensure robust 5-fold cross-validation
- [ ] **Mixed precision training** for memory efficiency

## **Inference Speed Optimization (Master's Requirement: 10% improvement)**

Based on FLARE22/FLARE23 challenge solutions, implement these strategies:

### **Model Optimization**
- [ ] **Model quantization**: Convert to INT8 or FP16 precision
- [ ] **Model pruning**: Remove redundant parameters
- [ ] **Knowledge distillation**: Train a smaller, faster model
- [ ] **TensorRT optimization** for NVIDIA GPUs

### **Inference Pipeline Optimization**
- [ ] **Optimized sliding window prediction**: Reduce overlap, optimize patch sizes
- [ ] **Multi-scale inference**: Use coarse-to-fine prediction strategies
- [ ] **Batch processing**: Process multiple patches simultaneously
- [ ] **Memory optimization**: Reduce memory footprint during inference

## **Domain-Specific Improvements**

### **Pancreas Segmentation Challenges**
- [ ] **Class imbalance handling**: Pancreas lesions are typically very small compared to normal pancreas
- [ ] **Multi-scale feature extraction**: Capture both fine-grained lesion details and broader anatomical context
- [ ] **Region-based training**: Focus training on pancreas regions
- [ ] **Post-processing**: Connected component analysis, morphological operations

### **Performance Targets (Master's Level)**
You need to achieve:
- [ ] Whole pancreas DSC: 0.91+
- [ ] Pancreas lesion DSC: 0.31+
- [ ] Classification macro-F1: 0.7+
- [ ] Inference speed improvement: 10%

## **Experimental Approach**

### **Systematic Evaluation**
- [ ] **Baseline comparison**: Document your current baseline performance
- [ ] **Ablation studies**: Test each improvement individually
- [ ] **Hyperparameter tuning**: Learning rates, loss weights, augmentation probabilities
- [ ] **Cross-validation**: Ensure robust evaluation across all folds
- [ ] **Use "Metrics Reloaded" guidelines** for proper evaluation

### **Implementation Priority**

#### **High Priority**
- [ ] Multi-task architecture implementation
- [ ] Enhanced data augmentation
- [ ] Loss function optimization

#### **Medium Priority**
- [ ] Ensemble methods
- [ ] Advanced training strategies

#### **Master's Requirement**
- [ ] Inference speed optimization (10% improvement)

## **Notes**

The key is to implement these improvements systematically, measuring the impact of each change on your validation set before moving to the next optimization. Focus particularly on the multi-task learning architecture since that's the core requirement, then work on the domain-specific challenges of pancreas lesion segmentation.

**Remember**: Start with the baseline documentation, then implement changes incrementally with proper ablation studies to understand what actually improves performance.
